> a super simple command line note taking application that makes life easier

## How to use ?
You dont have to learn it if you know how to use `git` from command line.
- your notes directory is like your repository
- your `officeTasks.txt`, `todos.txt` etc files are like branches in the repo
- your commits are the notes you have on a particular branch
- much more elaborate readme coming soon.
